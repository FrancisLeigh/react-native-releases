# 0.59

Welcome to the February 2019 release of React Native! This is another big release with 644 commits by 88 contributors. Contributions also come in other forms, so *thank you* for maintaining issues, fostering communities, and teaching people about React Native. This month brings a number of highly anticipated changes, and we hope you enjoy them.

## Hooks are here

[React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) are here, which powers functional reuse across components. This addition has a lot of buzz about it; take a look at some of the wonderful resources below to learn more:

> - [Introducing Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) explains why we’re adding Hooks to React.
> - [Hooks at a Glance](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-overview.html) is a fast-paced overview of the built-in Hooks.
> - [Building Your Own Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-custom.html) demonstrates code reuse with custom Hooks.
> - [Making Sense of React Hooks](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/making-sense-of-react-hooks-fdbde8803889) explores the new possibilities unlocked by Hooks.
> - [useHooks.com](https://usehooks.com/) showcases community-maintained Hooks recipes and demos.

Be sure to give this a try in your apps. We hope that you find the reuse as exciting as we do.

## Big Performance Gains and 64-bit Support on Android

The Android platform on React Native has an embedded WebKit JavaScript engine that powers most of your application (it's called the "JavaScript Core" or "JSC"). The JSC was quite out of date, which meant that a lot of modern JavaScript features weren't supported. Even worse, it performed poorly compared iOS's modern JSC. With this release, that all changes.

Thanks to some awesome work by [@DanielZlotin](https://twitter.com/danielzlotin), the JSC has caught up with the past few years. This brings with it 64-bit support, modern JavaScript support, and [big performance improvements](https://github.com/react-native-community/jsc-android-buildscripts/tree/master/measure). Kudos to Daniel for also making this a maintainable process now so that we can take advantage of future WebKit improvements without so much legwork.

## Faster app launches with inline requires

We want to help people have performant React Native apps by default and are working to bring Facebook's optimizations to the community. [@eli_white](https://twitter.com/eli_white) did incredible work to help applications load resources as needed rather than slowing down launch. This feature is called "inline requires", as it lets the packager identify components to be lazy loaded. Apps with a deep and varied component architecture will see the most improvement.

![source of the `metro.config.js` file in the 0.59 template, demonstrating where to enable `inlineRequires`](resources/inline-requires.png)

We need the community to let us know how it works before we turn it on by default. When you upgrade to 0.59, there will be a new `metro.config.js` file; flip the `inlineRequires` option and give us [your feedback](https://twitter.com/hashtag/inline-requires)! Read more about inline requires [in the performance docs](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/0.56/performance#inline-requires) to learn how to see it works and benchmark your app before/after.

## Lean core is underway

React Native is a large and complex project with a complicated repository. This makes the codebase less approachable to contributors, difficult to test, and bloated as a dev dependency. [Lean Core](https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/6) is our effort to address these issues by migrating code to separate libraries for better management. The past few releases have seen the first steps of this, but [let's get serious](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMLKb4or8yg).

You may notice that **AsyncStorage**, **ImageStore**, **MaskedViewIOS**, **NetInfo**, **Slider**, **Switch**, and **ViewPagerAndroid** are now officially deprecated. This is great news, as there are now owners for these features actively maintaining them. Heed the warning messages and migrate to the new libraries for these features, because in 0.60 they will be removed.

Over the coming months, there will be many more components following this path to a leaner core. We're looking for help with this &mdash; head over to the [lean core umbrella](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/23313) to pitch in.

## CLI improvements

React Native's command like tools are developer's entrypoint to the ecosystem, but they had long-standing issues and lacked official support. The CLI tools have been moved to a separate repository, and a dedicated group of maintainers have already made some exciting improvements.

Logs are formatted much better now. Commands now run nearly instantly &mdash; you'll immediately notice a difference:

![0.58's CLI is slow to start](resources/0.58-cli-speed.png)![0.58's CLI is nearly instananeous](resources/0.59-cli-speed.png)

Some long-standing issues have been fixed too. Thanks to the [dedicated group of maintainers](https://blog.callstack.io/the-react-native-cli-has-a-new-home-79b63838f0e6) working in a [new repository](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-cli). This work was proposed in [RFC0003](https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0003-Extracted-Command-Line-Tools.md), and we're excited to see it completed.
